# Operating System-PROJECT
SELF WRITTEN SHELL

 # Problem Statement:
  
This project aims to write our own shell and execute different commands created by us. A shell is a program that creates an environment to execute commands. The shell first reads and executes its configuration files in the initializing phase. These change aspects of shell's behavior. It then reads commands that the user write through stdin which could either be a written command or file. After all the execution of commands, the shells terminates,executes any shutdown commands and frees up any memory
